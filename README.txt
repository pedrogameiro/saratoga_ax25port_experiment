Saratoga transfer protocol - Vallona implementation
===================================================

This is work in progress on an implementation of the
Saratoga data transfer protocol by Charles Smith,
owner of Vallona Networks.

This will implement most of version 1 of Saratoga,
which is described in:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wood-tsvwg-saratoga

Further information on Saratoga and its uses is
available from:
http://saratoga.sourceforge.net/

This implementation is free and without warranty,
under a nonrestrictive BSD license, as described in
the accompanying License.txt file.

To build this code, you will need to already have
installed:
- the SCons build package. SCons requires python.
- gcc and g++ compilers, or similar.
- the ncurses terminal library, or similar.
